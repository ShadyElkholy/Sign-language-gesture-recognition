I've used Jupyter notebook using Anaconda to create this project.

-import "jupyter notebook enviroment.yaml" enviroment as it was the enviroment I've created this project on.

-download the vgg16 model using the following link and place it in the same folder as the codes.

https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5

-Create a dataset using the Main app first and then go to the model creator to create a model.

-Then you can go back to the main app and do the predictions.
